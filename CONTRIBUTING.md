# Contributing to Pal

> For people — and agents — working **on** Pal. If you are *adopting* Pal in an app, start with [Getting Started](Documentation/GettingStarted.md) instead.

## Build & verify

```bash
swift build        # all package targets
swift test         # smoke + targeted tests
# Example app: open Example/PalExample.xcodeproj (or xcodebuild -project … -scheme PalExample)
```

Every change must leave `swift build` + `swift test` green **and** the Example app compiling. CI enforces this on push/PR (GitHub Actions, macOS runner). The macOS 14 platform floor exists only so the host can build/test; products target iOS — UIKit-only surfaces are gated with `#if canImport(UIKit)`.

## The rules are binding

The naming conventions and the 12 clean-code rules in [DECISIONS.md §4–5](Documentation/DECISIONS.md) (mirrored in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) / [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)) are binding for humans and agents alike. Highlights worth re-reading before a PR: `///` on every public symbol · no force-unwraps/`AnyView`/`print` · scoped naming (foundation API uses standard Swift naming; the `…Protocol` suffix is app-layer only) · errors mapped at boundaries.

**Documentation follows every change.** When you add or change a public API, a decision, or a product's behavior, update the affected docs in the same change: the relevant [product guide](Documentation/Products/), [DECISIONS.md](Documentation/DECISIONS.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md), and the status below.

## Governance: decisions are a living document

[DECISIONS.md](Documentation/DECISIONS.md) records the intended design. Pal is built to be scalable and maintainable, so it is **open to discussion** — propose changes rather than drifting silently. When implementation reality conflicts with the design, **stop, surface the conflict, and record the resolution in the deviations log below.** The design text stays authoritative; this log is the audit trail of approved exceptions.

## Source control (GitFlow)

- **`main`** — the live branch consumers track. Only **tagged releases** land here; never commit features directly to it.
- **`develop`** — the integration branch where finished features accumulate between releases.
- **`feature/{name}`** — branch off `develop`; merge back into `develop` when done.
- **`hotfix/{name}`** — branch off `main` for an urgent fix; merge into **both** `main` (tag a patch, e.g. `v1.0.1`) **and** `develop` (so the next release doesn't revert it).
- A release is `develop → main` plus a SemVer **tag**. **Consumers pin to tags, never to a branch.**
- **Merge discipline:** push the `feature/*` (or `hotfix/*`) branch and **request review before merging** — don't self-merge into `develop`/`main` without a cross-check. *(Active from the Notifications feature onward.)*

## Compatibility & evolution

Pal is consumed by multiple apps, so the public API is a **contract** — *open to extension, closed to modification.*

- **Evolve additively.** New types, new parameters with default values, and new protocol requirements **only with default implementations** (a bare new requirement breaks every conformer in every app).
- **Deprecate, don't delete.** Keep the old symbol and forward it; remove only at a major bump, a release after the deprecation:
  ```swift
  @available(*, deprecated, renamed: "send(_:)")
  public func execute<R>(_ request: Request<R>) async throws(NetworkError) -> R { try await send(request) }
  ```
- **Mind enums.** Adding a `case` to a public enum is source-breaking (consumer `switch`es are exhaustive) — reserve case additions for a major.
- **SemVer mapping:** additive → minor · fix → patch · breaking → major (with deprecations first). Pre-1.0 a minor *may* break, so consumers pin **`.upToNextMinor(from:)`** and we still prefer additive changes.
- **Consumers track tags, never branches.** No `release/x.y.z` branch is meant to be followed; a `release/*` branch (if ever used) is a short-lived hardening branch deleted after tagging, and a long-lived `1.x` maintenance line exists only to backport fixes across a major.
- **At `1.0.0`:** add `swift package diagnose-api-breaking-changes <previous-tag>` as a **required CI gate** (it builds the baseline + current public API and fails on a break). Deferred until 1.0 on purpose — pre-1.0 breaks are legal, so the check would mostly be noise now.

## Implementation status

Each phase ends GREEN: `swift build` + `swift test` pass and the Example app compiles.

Tests today: smoke + MemoryCache + TokenProvider single-flight + interceptor-chain + Router + Loader (incl. `refresh`) + DebugKit (log ring buffer, inspector capture, mock interceptor 2xx/non-2xx + global-off un-mocks-all, env store broadcast/re-select/removal-fallback, resolver fallback). The Example app builds for the iOS Simulator (0 warnings), dogfooding **all 10 products** (DebugKit wired behind `DEBUGKIT`).

> **Toward `v1.0.0`:** all 10 products ship as of `v0.13.0` (runtime-confirmed in the simulator). `1.0.0` follows a planned **Notifications** (push + local) feature.

## Deviations log

The audit trail of approved exceptions where implementation reality met the design.

- **Phase 1 — macOS 14 platform floor added to `Package.swift`.** `swift build`/`swift test`/CI compile for the host Mac; without a declared floor SPM assumes macOS 10.13 and modern APIs (os.Logger, Duration, Observation) fail. Products remain iOS-targeted; macOS is build-infrastructure only; UIKit-only surfaces get `#if canImport(UIKit)`.
- **Phase 1 — `AppInfo` distribution detection (TestFlight/App Store) deferred.** The modern API (`AppTransaction`) requires StoreKit, breaching Core's Foundation-only rule; the receipt heuristic is deprecated. Ship nothing rather than either cost; `distribution() async` is purely additive later, where the first consumer lives.
- **Phase 2 — privacy manifest added to PalCore as well** (design mentioned only PalPersistence): `AppLanguage` writes `AppleLanguages` via UserDefaults — a required-reason API (CA92.1) — so PalCore must also declare it.
- **Polish pass (post-POC) — status docs were stale.** `CLAUDE.md` "Current status" and the phase list still read "Phase 0 / empty stubs" at `v0.9.0` — caught by the TheLoot adoption agent. Fixed. **Process rule: update status docs every phase.**
- **Polish pass — runner redesigned `LoadableViewModelProtocol` → `Loader<Value>`.** The protocol+extension couldn't keep `state` `private(set)` against a `{get set}` requirement (its canonical example didn't compile) and supported only one loadable state per VM. Replaced by an owned `Loader<Value>` object: encapsulated state, no `loadTask` boilerplate, multiple sections per screen. **Breaking API change (pre-1.0, acceptable).** A compile-tested reference example (`PalPresentationTests`) now guards the canonical pattern from silent rot.
- **Polish pass — PalDesignSystem `Theme` extended + reframed.** Added a shadow/elevation scale (`ThemeShadows` + `.shadow(_ token:)`), a `separator` color, and `tracking`/`lineSpacing` on `TextStyleToken`; softened the custom-font "MUST `relativeTo:`" to allow fixed sizes; documented `Theme` as a deliberate minimal bridge.
- **Documentation pass — consumer-facing docs added; history relocated here.** Added per-product guides (`Documentation/Products/`), a Getting Started guide, and this file; reframed `DECISIONS.md` as a design reference (history moved out) and softened its framing to "open to discussion". Implementation history (phase status + this deviations log) now lives here, separated from the consumer docs.
- **Phase 9 — PalDebugKit is the one UIKit-using package.** Shake detection and above-everything overlay aren't expressible in pure SwiftUI, so DebugKit contains UIKit behind `#if canImport(UIKit)` (`UIViewControllerRepresentable` for `.onShake`, `UIWindow` for the overlay) — the only Pal package importing UIKit; the macOS host build excludes it. `HTTPClient.baseURLProvider` was reintroduced for per-request env switching. Env routing splits into a nonisolated `EnvironmentResolver` (synchronous reads backing the `@Sendable` `baseURLProvider`) + a `@MainActor` `EnvironmentStore` (UI + persistence). An artificial-latency knob was prototyped for mocks (stored in milliseconds — `Duration` isn't `Codable`) and later cut in the owner's pre-publish review; the shipped editor is mocked/status/body only. The debug menu is **deliberately not localized** (developer-facing, not user-facing) — an exception to the en+el rule. DebugModule registration is realized as built-in tabs + a `@ViewBuilder` slot (no type-erased registry, honoring no-`AnyView`).
- **Phase 9 polish (pre-publish, `v0.13.0`).** Pull-to-refresh: added `Loader.refresh(_:)` (in-place reload — no `.loading`, since the refresh control is the indicator) plus the keep-the-scrollable-mounted pattern (empty/error as overlays), after the Example surfaced a "change the refresh control while it is not idle" conflict on a refresh-to-empty. DebugKit UI refined per owner review — Logs: always-visible search, request body + query params in detail, larger body cap; Mocks: a searchable list of every executed call (reusing the Logs row) with a focused 3-control editor (mocked / status / body), mocked-first ordering, and global-off un-mocks everything.
- **Phase 10 built ahead of Phase 9 (owner preference).** A runnable Example showcase (Users canonical slice + Settings) dogfooding the 9 shipped products via manual DI against a public API; PalDebugKit is excluded until Phase 9. Each Pal product was linked into the app target in `project.pbxproj` (sources auto-include via Xcode's synchronized file groups). Because the app target sets `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`, the Domain/Data value types are marked `nonisolated` so DTOs decode and entities construct off the main actor — exactly the adoption guidance in [ARCHITECTURE.md](Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Docs pass — MyRecipes adoption feedback (no source change).** A second test app (local-only SwiftData CRUD, Swinject DI) built fully on Pal **section by section with zero foundation changes** — strong evidence the API is followable from docs alone, and a live proof of the additive-evolution policy (every finding was a docs gap, not a wrong mechanism). Actions: (1) fixed two non-compiling shipped snippets — GettingStarted's `.task { performLoad { refresh() } }` (the closure must return `Value`, not `Void`) and PalNavigation/GettingStarted's `RouterView` (omitted the required `root:` route case); (2) **extended the compile-tested-snippet discipline** to the `RouterView` usage (`PalNavigationTests`) and the `performLoad`-based VM `load()` (`PalPresentationTests`) so consumer-doc snippets can't silently drift from the API; (3) added adoption guidance with **no code/deps in Pal** — SwiftData-behind-repositories (`@ModelActor` + domain-struct mapping + re-fetch-after-write), app-layer modularization as local SPM packages, and a `nonisolated`-tokens note for `MainActor`-default isolation; (4) recorded the **source-control (GitFlow)** + **compatibility/evolution** policy (above). The coverage caveat stands: a local-only app leaves PalNetworking/PalAuth/most of DebugKit/MemoryCache unexercised — a networked second test app would validate the other half (the Example app already covers the networked path).
